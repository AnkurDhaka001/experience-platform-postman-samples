# Adobe Experience Platform APIs

This set of Postman Collections corresponds to the public [Adobe Experience Platform APIs](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html). Download and import the full collection by using the [Adobe Experience Platform Postman Collection](Adobe%20Experience%20Platform.postman_collection.json) or only download and import specific colletions from the [raw apis](/raw-apis) folder.


## Dependenicies

### Adobe I/O Project
These Postman Collections have been set up to share the Postman Variable collections generated via [Adobe I/O Console's Integrations](https://console.adobe.io/integrations) (Export Details to Postman), which generates a Postman Environment file with the selected integrations values.

### Obtaining an Access Token

To obtain a valid access token to interact with the APIs in these Postman Collections, use the provided [Adobe I/O Access Token Generation.postman_collection.json](../ims). This collection is already integrated with the other Adobe Experience Platform API collections and the Adobe I/O Project's __Export Details to Postman__ environment settings.
